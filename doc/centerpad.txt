This is a simple plugin that at the moment takes your current buffer and plops
it into the middle of your screen, with two scratch buffers on either side.
Nothing more than that! Of course, the width of how big the padding on each side
of your screen is easily configurable as well! This plugin is simple by nature,
as it is my first attempt at a Lua plugin, and really was just a utility module
that I wrote for my own neovim dotfiles, that I figured I could pretty easily
turn into a small plugin that a few others might get some use out of.

USAGE                                                               *centerpad*

All you will have to do is run the command `:Centerpad` or `:lua
require'centerpad'.toggle()` to toggle centering of your current buffer on/off.
The `:Centerpad` command accepts 1-2 arguments, you can pass it one number to
use for both sides of the centered buffer (i.e. `:Centerpad 20`), or two numbers
if you want the left and right scratch buffers to use different sizing (i.e.
  `:Centerpad 10 20`).

CONFIGURATION

By default, centerpad.nvim will set the left and right padding to 36 columns
each. If you want to override this, I'd recommend setting up a keybinding in
your vim config similar to what I have in my own config:

IN YOUR INIT.LUA
```lua
-- using the command
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(
  'n',
  '<leader>z',
  '<cmd>Centerpad<cr>',
  { silent = true, noremap = true }
)

-- or using the lua function
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(
  'n',
  '<leader>z',
  "<cmd>lua require'centerpad'.toggle{ leftpad = 20, rightpad = 20 }<cr>",
  { silent = true, noremap = true }
)
```

IN YOUR INIT.VIM
```vim
" using the command
nnoremap <silent><leader>z <cmd>Centerpad<cr>

" or using the lua function
nnoremap <silent><leader>z <cmd>lua require'centerpad'.toggle {
  leftpad = 36,
  rightpad = 36
}<cr>
```

The `leftpad` and `rightpad` options will adjust the padding for the scratch
buffers on the left and right side of your main buffer, respectively.
