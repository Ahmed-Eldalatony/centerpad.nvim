This is a simple plugin that at the moment takes your current buffer and plops
it into the middle of your screen, with two scratch buffers on either side.
Nothing more than that! Of course, the width of how big the padding on each
side of your screen is easily configurable as well! This plugin is simple by
nature, as it is my first attempt at a Lua plugin, and really was just a
utility module that I wrote for my own neovim dotfiles, that I figured I could
pretty easily turn into a small plugin that a few others might get some use out
of.

CONFIGURATION                                                       *centerpad*

All you will have to do is run the command `:Centerpad` (which always runs with
the default options) or `:lua require'centerpad'.toggle()` to toggle centering
of your current buffer on/off. By default, centerpad.nvim will set the left and
right padding to 40 columns each. If you want to override this, I'd recommend
setting up a keybinding in your vim config similar to what I have in my own
config:

IN YOUR INIT.VIM
```vim
nnoremap <silent><leader>z :lua require'centerpad'.toggle{\
leftpad = 40, rightpad = 40 }<cr>
```

IN YOUR INIT.LUA
```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(
  'n',
  '<leader>z',
  ":lua require'centerpad'.toggle{ leftpad = 20, rightpad = 20 }<cr>",
  { noremap = true, silent = true }
)
```

The `leftpad` and `rightpad` options will adjust the padding for the scratch
buffers on the left and right side of your main buffer, respectively.
